What is the Super Learner?

The super learner is a general loss-based learning method designed to find the optimal
combination of a set of learners.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
The super learner framework is built on the theory
of cross-validation and allows for a general class of algorithms to be considered for
the ensemble.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,000
The oracle results for the cross-validation selector are extended to the
super learner.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
Due to the established oracle results for the cross-validation selector,
the super learner is proven to represent an asymptotically optimal framework for
learning.

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,000
We discuss the super learner algorithm and demonstrate the method on a
series of data analysis problems.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:18,000
The super learner framework is extended to cover
censored data by applying an appropriate observed data loss function.

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,000
The final
chapter presents an R package for implementing the super learner based on a general
library of learners.

Chapter 1

Introduction

One of the most commonly used statistical procedures is estimator selection.
Given a set of observations and a collection of candidate learners, an estimator selection procedure traditionally selects a single estimator from the collection based on a
criterion (e.g.

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,000
minimizing the negative log likelihood).

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,000
Numerous methods exist for
the candidate learners, an overview of various statistical methods for the candidate
learners can be found in [44].
The super learner is based on the general theory of loss-based estimation [87].
Therefore, the framework applies to a variety of estimation problems including density
estimation and prediction.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,000
As long as the parameter of interest can be defined as the
minimizer of the expected loss function, the super learner framework will apply.
Before introducing the super learner, a short description of cross-validation is
presented.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
The second chapter contains the proposed super learner algorithm and
the oracle results.

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
Chapter 3 contains a collection of practical demonstrations of
the super learner on both simulated and real data sets.

13
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Chapter 4 is an extended
example of the super learner for the specific case of predicting treatment effects.
Chapter 5 outlines how the super learner framework can be extended to censored
data.

14
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Chapter 6 contains a detailed description of the software implementation of
the super learner framework.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Finally, Chapter 7 contains the conclusion and future
work..
